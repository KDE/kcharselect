o Remove the useless "What's this?" widget from title bar.
o Modify kcharselect library to allow "space" to insert a space.
o Figure out how to use a horizontal layout for "Clear", "To Clipboard", and the line edit.
o Mark which glyphs are subsitutes (requires QT support).
o Don't use the grid layout class - it's more trouble than it's worth.
